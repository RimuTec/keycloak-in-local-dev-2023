# According to the compose spec we can specify the compose project name here. However, VS Code does
# not honor this as of 21 Apr 2023. Therefore there is a .env file at the root of this git repository
# in which the environment variable COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME is defined as 'rimutec'. Once VS Code supports
# the top-level element 'name', the following can be used instead.
name: 'rimutec'
